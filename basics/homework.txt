Homework Questions From First Section

1.  Write a function that lets a user input a list of 5 numbers and then calculate
    the sum of those numbers.

2.  Write a function that gets a list of 3 names and then goes through every name
    in that list and if the length of the name is more than 5 letters, print a
    message saying that the name is too long else the name length is just right!

NOTE:   Instead of one big function to accomplish the task, see if you can break it
        down into 2 smaller functions and have one function that uses both of them to
        accomplish the task!
